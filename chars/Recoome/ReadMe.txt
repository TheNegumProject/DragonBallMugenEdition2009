Recoome crushes his enemies with his massive strength. Recoome isn't the brightest bulb, and is kind of a goofball,
but then again who isn't in the Ginyu Force). Recoome shows his might against Vegeta, Gohan, and Krillin on Namek, 
Successfully beating all of them, however he was stopped by Goku and soon after killed off by Vegeta.
	Recoome shows up again in the show with other members of the Force to take King Kai's home, they are stopped 
by Yamcha and company. Recoome spends the rest of his DBZ days in Hell or HFIL or whatever they call it.
