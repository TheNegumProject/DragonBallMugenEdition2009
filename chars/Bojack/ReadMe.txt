Character Information:
	Bojack is the lead bad guy in Dragon Ball Z: Movie 9. After Cell destroyed King Kai's planet something
	bad happened and Bojack and his band of space pirates were let loose. They decide to attack Earth for 
	some reason(probably because they want the hot women). Bojack and his group are very strong, but they tend 
	to resort to trickery to defeat the Z-Fighters. Bojack is eventually destroyed by Gohan, but not after 
	giving him and everyone else a run for their money. I think that's the jist of Movie 9. =D

Changes:
	Version 1.00b(Public Beta)

If you don't enjoy this character, noone is stopping you from deleting it. Just make sure I don't have to hear about it. ^_^

Good luck in the MUGEN world Bojack, and may your sprites forever remain untouched by all others except DW himself.

I like girls.
